		<div id="about-app" class="full">
			<h3>The App</h3>
			<p>Our free app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.cumulonimbus.barometernetwork" target="_blank">pressureNET</a> allows users to track atmospheric pressure changes over time using the barometer in their Android device. Users can also submit current weather conditions in their precise location. This crowd-sourced data is collected and provided to meteorological researchers who are using the data to improve weather forecasting models.</p>
			<p>Our users’ privacy is of utmost importance to us. When the app is first installed and launched, the user is asked to set their information sharing settings. These can be changed at any later point in the Settings menu. The most popular choice set by our users is to share their data with academic researchers, professional forecasters and Cumulonimbus. An option to share with the public exists as well, and will provide an accessible open data set for public use.</p>
			<p>The project is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/Cbsoftware/pressureNET" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
			<p>If you have an Android device, please consider downloading <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.cumulonimbus.barometernetwork" target="_blank">pressureNET from Google Play</a> to contribute to science experiments and research of Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

			<h3>The Live Stream</h3>
			<p>We’re providing the data collected from the app to academic researchers. Ultimately, they’re using this data to improve weather forecasting models. Current progress is in data quality control and research targets are the initiation of convection in thunderstorms.</p>
			<p>If you’re a researcher and would like access to the data, check out the <a href="{% url 'customers-livestream'%}">live stream</a> page and get in touch.</p>

		<div id="about-sdk" class="full">
			<h3>The SDK</h3>
      <p>We’ve developed an <a href="https://github.com/Cbsoftware/pressureNET-SDK" target="_blank">open source SDK</a> to allow other Android apps devlopers to include pressureNET in their apps and services.</p>

      <p>If you’re an Android developer and would like to integrate pressureNET into your app or discuss other collaboration, check out the code and <a href="mailto:software@cumulonimbus.ca">send us an email</a>.</p>
